The Difference Between Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases
--------------------------------------------------------------                       
____________________
Relational Databases
____________________

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. They're based on the relational model which is a direct, straightforward way of representing data in tables. Each row and table has a unique ID called the key. Columns represent attributes. Tables are related to other tables.  

-Rows are called tuples.

-Columns are called attributes or properties.

-Tables are called relations and entities or objects.

-Views can be generated which are a saved set of results.

Relationships
_____________
Each table has a primary key to uniquely identify a record so there is not repetition. A foreign key is the ID in the other table used to set up a relationship in another table to bring tables together. A foreign key is also a reference to a primary key in another table. Tables can be joined together by using a foreign key in one table and linking it to a primary key in another table (can be done using a query.

Non-Relational Databases
________________________

A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored. They tend to be more specific in the type of data they support and how data can be queried. Non-relational databases have grown in popularity because they were designed to overcome the limitations of relational databases in dealing with Big Data demands. Big Data refers to data that is growing and moving too fast and is too diverse in structure for conventional technologies to handle.

In non-relational databases, there are no joins like there would be in relational databases. This means you need to perform multiple queries and join the data manually within your code which can cause many issues.
