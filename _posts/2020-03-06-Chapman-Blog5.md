Markdown Basic Syntax
---------------------

Mentioned below is the syntax for Markdown. Our weekly blogs are in Markdown and I have yet to use proper syntax. Listed are the best practices for text when creating a markdown file.

### Headings

Headings are created by adding number signs ($) in front of a word or phrase

        **# Heading 1**
        **## Heading 2**
        **### Heading 3**
        **#### Heading 4**
        **##### Heading 5**
        **###### Heading 6**

***Paragraphs don't require any special characters. Just make sure there is a black line between each paragraph.***
***Break lines occur when text starts on a new line.***

### Emphasis

You can make text bold or italic by adding emphasis to the text.

        **bold text**
        __bold text__ (do not use in a sentence)
        This is **bold text**
