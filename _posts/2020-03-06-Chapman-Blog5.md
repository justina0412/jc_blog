Markdown Basic Syntax
---------------------

Mentioned below is the syntax for Markdown. Our weekly blogs are in Markdown and I have yet to use proper syntax. Listed are a few of the best practices for text when creating a markdown file.

### Headings

Headings are created by adding number signs ($) in front of a word or phrase

        # Heading 1
        ## Heading 2
        ### Heading 3
        #### Heading 4
        ##### Heading 5
        ###### Heading 6

### Paragraphs & Break Lines

Paragraphs don't require any special characters. Just make sure there is a black line between each paragraph.
Break lines occur when text starts on a new line.

### Emphasis

You can make text bold or italic by adding emphasis to the text.

        **bold text**
        __bold text__ (do not use in a sentence, only with standalone text)
        This is **bold text**.

        *italic text*
        _italic text_ (do not use in a sentence, only with standalone text)
        This is *italic text*.

        ***bold & italic text***
        ____bold & italic text____ (do not use in a sentence, only with standalone text)
        This is **_bold & italic text_**.
        This is __*bold & italic text*__.
        This is **8bold & italic text***.

### Lists

**Ordered Lists**

Items can be organized in ordered and unordered lists.

        1. First item
        2. Second item
        3. Third item
        4. Fourth item

        OR

        1. First item
        1. Second item
        1. Third item
        1. Fourth item

        OR

        1. First item
        8. Second item
        3. Third item
        5. Fourth item

        ***It doesn't matter what the actual number are in the list. It reads the list from top to bottom.***

        1. First item
        2. Second item
        3. Third item
            1. Indented item
            2. Indented item
        4. Fourth item

**Unordered Lists**

        To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

        - First item
        - Second item
        - Third item
        - Fourth item

        OR

        * First item
        * Second item
        * Third item
        * Fourth item

        OR

        + First item
        * Second item
        - Third item
        + Fourth item

        OR

        - First item
        - Second item
        - Third item
            - Indented item
            - Indented item
        - Fourth item
